## Bounty Submission

**Bounty**: Closes #ISSUE_NUMBER

**RTC Wallet**: YOUR_WALLET_NAME

> **RTC wallets are string names** (e.g. `my-wallet`, `alice`, `builder-fred`).
> Do NOT use ETH/SOL/ERG addresses. Pick any name and start mining:
> `pip install clawrtc && clawrtc --wallet your-name`
>
> RustChain is a long-term project. Bounties grow the ecosystem — not for quick cash-outs.
> If you won't support what you build, don't build it.
