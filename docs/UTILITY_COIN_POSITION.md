# RustChain Utility Coin Position (No ICO / Self-Funded)

Last updated: 2026-02-20 (rev B)

This document explains RustChain's operating position for RTC and contributor payouts.
It is a policy statement for transparency, not legal advice.

## Core Facts

- RustChain/RTC has taken **0 VC capital**.
- Elyan Labs has self-funded the lab, infrastructure, tools, and development to date.
- One small private contribution (~$5,000 USD) has been received.
- No ICO, no presale, and no pump.fun-style launch was used.
- RTC is the native utility coin of the RustChain network.
- RTC is mined/earned through network participation and accepted work.

## What RTC Is (and Is Not)

RTC is designed as a utility coin for:

- network mining rewards
- settlement/payout accounting
- contributor and operator incentives

RTC is **not** presented as:

- an ownership share in Elyan Labs
- a guaranteed-return instrument
- a promise of exchange listing/liquidity
- a promise of USD/USDC convertibility

## Howey-Factor Operating Position (Facts-Based)

We structure operations to avoid investment-contract behavior:

1. Investment of money:
- participation does not require purchasing RTC from project issuers
- contributors can earn RTC by shipping accepted work or mining

2. Common enterprise:
- network participation is permissionless and protocol-driven
- rewards are determined by transparent network and payout rules

3. Expectation of profit:
- no price-performance promises
- no appreciation guarantees
- no "get rich" or "investor return" marketing language in policy

4. Efforts of others:
- participants earn primarily through their own work (compute, code, operations)
- maintainers publish objective payout evidence (`pending_id`, `tx_hash`, confirmation state)

## Funding and Compensation Disclosure

- Bounties are optional open-source incentives paid in native RTC for verified work.
- We may support optional wrapped rails (for example wRTC/eRTC) as operational on-ramps/bridges when available.
- Wrapped rails are utility transport paths, not redemption guarantees.
- We do not guarantee token value, liquidity, market depth, convertibility, or cash-out timing.
- If a contributor requires guaranteed USDC/USD escrow settlement, this program may not be the right fit today.

## Optional Wrapped Rails (wRTC / eRTC)

- Any wrapped rail is subject to bridge uptime, external counterparties, and market conditions.
- Availability can be intermittent; routes may be paused, changed, or unavailable.
- Use of wrapped rails does not create ownership rights or yield guarantees.

## Public Auditability

- SECURITY / safe-harbor policy: `SECURITY.md`
- Bounty hygiene policy: `docs/BOUNTY_HYGIENE.md`
- Public payout ledger: `https://github.com/Scottcjn/rustchain-bounties/issues/104`

## Compliance Note

Regulatory treatment is facts-and-circumstances based and can change over time.
This policy is intended to keep project behavior clear, conservative, and utility-first.
