# wRTC Onboarding Tutorial

Welcome to the wRTC (Wrapped RustChain Credit) onboarding guide! This tutorial will walk you through everything you need to know about wRTC, how to acquire it, and what you can do with it.

## What is wRTC?

wRTC is the wrapped version of RTC (RustChain Credit), the native token for RustChain's AI mining ecosystem. It's built on the Solana blockchain, making it fast, cheap to transfer, and easily tradable on decentralized exchanges.

### Key Features

- ⚡ **Fast & Cheap Transactions:** Built on Solana for low fees and high throughput
- 🔁 **Bridgeable:** Convert wRTC ↔ BoTTube credits for content tipping
- 💎 **AI Mining Rewards:** Earn RTC by contributing to AI agent networks
- 🌐 **DEX Trading:** Trade on Raydium and other Solana DEXs

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with wRTC, you'll need:

1. **Solana Wallet** (Phantom, Solflare, or any Solana-compatible wallet)
2. **SOL tokens** for transaction fees (~0.01 SOL is usually sufficient)
3. **Basic understanding** of cryptocurrency and wallets

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Get a Solana Wallet

If you don't have a Solana wallet yet:

1. Install [Phantom Wallet](https://phantom.app/) (recommended)
2. Create a new wallet
3. **IMPORTANT:** Save your seed phrase securely and never share it
4. Add some SOL to your wallet for gas fees

### Step 2: Add wRTC to Your Wallet

**Using Phantom Wallet:**
1. Open Phantom
2. Click on the wallet icon
3. Click "Add Token"
4. Paste the mint address: `12TAdKXxcGf6oCv4rqDz2NkgxjyHq6HQKoxKZYGf5i4X`

3. Select SOL as the input token
4. Select wRTC as the output token
5. Enter the amount of SOL you want to swap
